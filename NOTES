$ rails openfrbr

Used the notes here to put everything under git:

http://toolmantim.com/article/2007/12/5/setting_up_a_new_rails_app_with_git

$ cat .gitignore
log/*.log
tmp/**/*
.DS_Store

$ touch log/.gitignore
$ touch tmp/.gitignore

$ ./script/generate scaffold work
$ ./script/generate scaffold expression
$ ./script/generate scaffold manifestation
$ ./script/generate scaffold item
$ ./script/generate scaffold person
$ ./script/generate scaffold family
$ ./script/generate scaffold corporate_body
$ ./script/generate scaffold concept
$ ./script/generate scaffold frbr_object (object is a reserved word)
$ ./script/generate scaffold event
$ ./script/generate scaffold place

$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial checkin in; a bit of scaffolding"

On the Eee I ran

$ cd src
$ git clone buff@10.1.0.9:src/openfrbr 

and it copied everything over.

First database migration

$ ./script/generate migration create_works_table
      exists  db/migrate
      create  db/migrate/20080721001523_create_works_table.rb

I edited the file and added basic stuff to make the works table

class CreateWorksTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :works do |table|
      table.column :title, :string
      table.column :form, :string
      table.column :date, :date
      table.column :comment, :string
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :works
  end
end

$ rake db.migrate

There was a bunch of output about all the various tables.

I'm not using these migrations right.  I wanted to load up the
development database with some initial data, and I knew that could be
done in migrations.  (Is this new to Rails 2?  Much of what I found
about this online seems out of date now.)  I made a new migration file
to load in the data, but it didn't take.  I then edited an early migration,
which didn't take either, so I had to do rake:db:migrate VERISON=0 to back to
the very start and then rake:db:migrate to catch up on everything.  I
don't know if this is the right way or not, but it works.

When I refreshed things on the Eee and ran script/server and hit
/works I got some kind of cookie error.  Data copied over by git that
shouldn't have been?  And then the migration stuff didn't work. Said
I'd already created the works table!

rake db:drop; rake db:migrate seems to work well for getting around any 
migration errors. It just drops everything and then you can start over.

Put a bunch of table configuration and test data into the migration files, 
including setting up the HABTM join tables.  Kept resetting the database 
and migrating it from scratch. Probably not the best way to do it, but it 
does sort of keep it tidy and gives me a decent baseline to work with for 
later, when I add attributes to the relationships between things.
