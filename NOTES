On the Eee I ran

$ cd src
$ git clone buff@10.1.0.9:src/openfrbr 

and it copied everything over.

First database migration

$ ./script/generate migration create_works_table
      exists  db/migrate
      create  db/migrate/20080721001523_create_works_table.rb

I edited the file and added basic stuff to make the works table

class CreateWorksTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :works do |table|
      table.column :title, :string
      table.column :form, :string
      table.column :date, :date
      table.column :comment, :string
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :works
  end
end

$ rake db.migrate

There was a bunch of output about all the various tables.

* 25 July 2008

I'm not using these migrations right.  I wanted to load up the
development database with some initial data, and I knew that could be
done in migrations.  (Is this new to Rails 2?  Much of what I found
about this online seems out of date now.)  I made a new migration file
to load in the data, but it didn't take.  I then edited an early migration,
which didn't take either, so I had to do rake:db:migrate VERISON=0 to back to
the very start and then rake:db:migrate to catch up on everything.  I
don't know if this is the right way or not, but it works.

When I refreshed things on the Eee and ran script/server and hit
/works I got some kind of cookie error.  Data copied over by git that
shouldn't have been?  And then the migration stuff didn't work. Said
I'd already created the works table!

* 28 July 2008

rake db:drop; rake db:migrate seems to work well for getting around any 
migration errors. It just drops everything and then you can start over.

Put a bunch of table configuration and test data into the migration files, 
including setting up the HABTM join tables.  Kept resetting the database 
and migrating it from scratch. Probably not the best way to do it, but it 
does sort of keep it tidy and gives me a decent baseline to work with for 
later, when I add attributes to the relationships between things.

* 31 July 2008

Did some more setting up of the entities and defining some test
data.  Didn't set up any relationships between PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
and Platform 9 3/4 as a place, though, or anything like that.

I had a look at the entity-relationship diagram I did that shows all of 
the FRBR entities and relationships, and realized my data model was wrong. 
I need to have attributes on the relationships, so instead of 
has_and_belongs_to_many I need to use has_many :through, and then set up 
the join with attributes.  A work can be created by Person A and also have 
Person B as a subject.  I don't want to clutter it all up with tons of 
different tables for all those joins.

Looked at a polymorphism plug-in but I don't feel like tackling that.

Since sqlite won't work on the Eee I tried to get it going with 
Postgresql, but I don't think I was running the daemon right because it 
couldn't connect.  I'd better tackle fixing sqlite again, before messing 
about with anything more serious.

* 2 August 2008

Checked FRBR and FRAD and updated the attributes on the entities.  Thought
about how to connect them all with has_many :through but haven't done
that yet.  Should use these expressions of FRBR in RDF:

  http://vocab.org/frbr/core
  http://vocab.org/frbr/extended
  
Created app/views/layouts/application.html.erb and then removed all of the
other layouts.  The application layout will be used by all views now.
I'll do a bit of CSS and styling to get a left nav going, or something
like that.

For fun I thought I'd try autocompletion on manifestation titles, just
to see how that worked.  Followed what is explained here:

  http://codeintensity.blogspot.com/2008/02/auto-complete-text-fields-in-rails-2.html
  
After a few minutes of this I decided I was getting ahead of myself, so I stopped.

Fiddled with the CSS so there's a left nav.

Removed public/index.html and added this to routes.rb:

  map.root :controller => "works"

Now the default for http://localhost:3000/ is to list all the works.

* 5 August 2008

I installed Ubuntu on my Eee and now I can use Rails without any
trouble.  I was getting errors with rake db:migrate on the old OS but
now all is well.

* 9 August 2008

After some fiddling around so that associated works are listed on the
subject pages, I'll try setting up has_many :through relations between
works and people just for starters. What I think I need is a
polymorphic many-to-many relationship between Group 1 and Group 2
entities, with attributes on the relationships.  Any Group 1 entity
can be in a variety of many-to-many relationships with any Group 2
entity, and if I can have that all in one model, that would be cool. I
think. I don't know. I'll start small and build up.  Not sure how this
will all go in migrations.  I think I need to use fixtures to set up
my test data.

I couldn't think of a word or phrase to sum up all of these different
relationships, so I just called the model TwoAndOne.

$ ./script/generate model TwoAndOne -g
      exists  app/models/
      exists  test/unit/
      exists  test/fixtures/
      create  app/models/two_and_one.rb
add 'app/models/two_and_one.rb'
      create  test/unit/two_and_one_test.rb
add 'test/unit/two_and_one_test.rb'
      create  test/fixtures/two_and_ones.yml
add 'test/fixtures/two_and_ones.yml'
      exists  db/migrate
      create  db/migrate/20080809163307_create_two_and_ones.rb
add 'db/migrate/20080809163307_create_two_and_ones.rb'

After some time not getting this to work, I decided to make a model
called Creator, and start by making it so that works and people were
in a many-to-many relationship this way.  That's more natural.
That's the way we talk.

./script/destroy model TwoAndOne -g

had a lot of output.

Later: Got this working.  My models look like this:

class Work < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :expressions
  has_many :people, :through => :creators
  has_many :creators
end

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :works, :through => :creators
  has_many :creators
end

class Creator < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :work
  belongs_to :person
end

I set up creators.yml with

one:
  work_id: 1
  person_id: 1
  relation: isAuthorOf

two:
  work_id: 2
  person_id: 1
  relation: isAuthorOf

three:
  work_id: 3
  person_id: 1
  relation: isAuthorOf

And now this does it in show.html.erb for people:

<ul>

<%- @person.creators.each do |c| %>

<li> <%= c.relation %> <%= link_to Work.find(c.work_id).title,
  :controller => "works",
  :action     => "show",
  :id         => c.work_id %> 
</li>

<%- end %>

</ul>

That says that she "isAuthorOf Harry Potter and the Philosopher's
Stone" and two others.

Getting families and corporate bodies into the mix won't be hard, but
I'm going to commit this now.

Question: How can I change the method name on people so that I can say
work.creators but person.creations?  I want the name of the
many-to-many relation to be different depending on which way I look at
it.  Must be some way to do that.

Later: Installed the has_many_polymorphs gem.

* 16 August 2008

Now I'm on the train back to Toronto.  The Creation and Creator models
are both broken, but I'm going to leave them that way for now.  To get
moving along I'm going to do a basic has_many :through polymorphic
relation to set up the Subject relationship.  Work is in a
many-to-many relationship with every other entity as a Subject: a Work
can have any of Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item, Person, Family,
Corporate Body, Concept, Event, Object, or Place as a subject.
There's only one relation: hasSubject (inverse isSubjectOf).

./script/generate model Subject -g

Hmm, I think that was stupid.  What I'd be doing there is a has_many
:through polymorphic association, which is what I was trying to do
with Creation, but couldn't get to work, so now I three broken and
incomplete things going on. 

All right, I'm going to revert to the last checkin to just wipe all
that out.

After more fooling around: bugger this, I need net access and I need
to get it working on a simple test example with no other stuff going
on.  

* 22 August 2008

I decided to start of simple and made a basic has_many :through
relation between Work and Person and called it Creation.  

class Creation < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :person
  belongs_to :work
end

class Work < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :creations
  has_many :people, :through => :creations
end

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :creations
  has_many :works, :through => :creations
end

And the migration:

class CreateCreations < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :creations do |t|
      t.column :person_id, :integer
      t.column :work_id, :integer
      t.column :relation, :string
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :creations
  end
end

That lets me do this:

buff:eee:~/src/openfrbr$ ./script/console

Good.

So that's a many-to-many relationship done, with an attribute on the
relation.  One Work can be created by many People, and one Person can
create many Works.

What I want to say is that Work is in a many-to-many Creation
relationship with all of People, Families, and Corporate Bodies.
That's a many-to-many polymorphic relation.  I'll use
has_many_polymorphs for that, but first, I think I'll get used to a
basic polymorphic relationship by setting up a one-to-many polymorphic
Realization relation between Expression and Person, Family, and
Corporate Body.  Then I'll have a many-to-many and a one-to-many
polymorphic and it should be easier to set up has_many_polymorphs with
that knowledge.

Insight: this is a one-to-many relation, so there's no new model to
set up.  Aha.  I did this:

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :expressions, :as => :realizer
end

class Family < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :expressions, :as => :realizer
end

class CorporateBody < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :expressions, :as => :realizer
end

class Expression < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :realizer, :polymorphic => true
end

And this is the migration:

class CreateRealizations < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    add_column :expressions, :realizer_id, :integer
    add_column :expressions, :realizer_type, :string
  end

  def self.down
    remove_column :expressions, :realizer_id
    remove_column :expressions, :realizer_type
  end
end

$ ./script/console 
Loading development environment (Rails 2.1.0)
>> p = Person.find(1)
=> #<Person id: 1, created_at: "2008-08-22 19:43:37", updated_at: "2008-08-22 19:43:37", name: "J.K. Rowling", dates: "31 July 1965", title: nil, other_designation: nil, affiliation: nil, country: nil, comment: nil>

>> e.save
=> true
>> e2.save
=> true

Then going into ./script/dbconsole and doing

sqlite> .dump expressions

shows that the ID number and type of the realizer have been stored,
for example:

INSERT INTO "expressions" VALUES(1,'2008-08-22 19:43:36','2008-08-22 19:50:27','Harry Potter and the Philosopher''s Stone','text','1997','English',NULL,1,1,'Person');

So that's how to do a one-to-many polymorphic relation.

I will check this in.

All righty. For my next move I will try using has_many_polymorphs with
a Production model to handle the relation between Manifestation and
Person, Family, and Corporate Body.

Got it working!

class Manifestation < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many_polymorphs :producers, :from => [:people, :families,  :corporate_bodies], :through => :productions
end

class Production < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :manifestation
  belongs_to :producers, :polymorphic => true
end

Nothing is needed in the Person, Family, and Corporate Body models,
because of the way that has_many_polymorphs works.

Here's the migration:

class CreateProductions < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :productions do |t|
      t.references :producer, :polymorphic => true
      t.references :manifestation
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :productions
  end
end

Here are some examples (leaving out some of the output):

>> p1 = Person.find(1); p2 = Person.find(2); c1 = CorporateBody.find(1); c2 = CorporateBody.find(2)
>> m1 = Manifestation.find(1); m2 = Manifestation.find(2)
>> m1.producers << p1; m1.producers << c1
>> m2.producers << p1; m2.producers << p2; m2.producers << c1; m2.producers << c2
>> m1.producers.each do |p|; puts "#{p.name} (#{p.class})"; end
J.K. Rowling (Person)
Raincoast Books (CorporateBody)
>> m2.producers.each do |p|; puts "#{p.name} (#{p.class})"; end
J.K. Rowling (Person)
Raincoast Books (CorporateBody)
Arthur A. Levine (CorporateBody)
William Denton (Person)

>> p1.productions
=> [#<Production id: 1, producer_id: 1, producer_type: "Person", manifestation_id: 1>, #<Production id: 3, producer_id: 1, producer_type: "Person", manifestation_id: 2>]
>> p1.productions.each do |p|; puts Manifestation.find(p.manifestation_id).title; end
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

So a Manifestation has producers and a Person, Family, or
CorporateBody has productions. That's perfect.  I will check this in.
The Production model is done.

There is one small thing I can't get working right, about the test
fixtures. I put this in test/fixtures/productions.yml:

PhilosopherProducer:
  manifestation_id: 1
  producer_id: 1
  producer_type: CorporateBody

ChamberProducer:
  manifestation_id: 2
  producer_id: 1
  producer_type: CorporateBody

AzkabanProducer:
  manifestation_id: 3
  producer_id: 1
  producer_type: CorporateBody

When I do 

rake db:drop; rake db:migrate; rake db:fixtures:load

then the database looks right and the productions table has the right
data in it.  But:

>> c = CorporateBody.find(1)
>> c.productions
NoMethodError: undefined method `productions' for #<CorporateBody:0xb6df6cac>
        from /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/activerecord-2.1.0/lib/active_record/attribute_methods.rb:256:in `method_missing'
        from (irb):2
>> m = Manifestation.find(1)
>> m.producers
=> [#<CorporateBody id: 1, created_at: "2008-08-23 02:29:11", updated_at: "2008-08-23 02:29:11", name: "Raincoast Books", dates: nil, other_designation: nil, place: "Vancouver, BC", comment: nil>]
>> m.producers << c
=> [#<CorporateBody id: 1, created_at: "2008-08-23 02:29:11", updated_at: "2008-08-23 02:29:11", name: "Raincoast Books", dates: nil, other_designation: nil, place: "Vancouver, BC", comment: nil>]
>> c.productions
=> [#<Production id: 366820064, producer_id: 1, producer_type: "CorporateBody", manifestation_id: 2>, #<Production id: 564650414, producer_id: 1, producer_type: "CorporateBody", manifestation_id: 3>, #<Production id: 831263640, producer_id: 1, producer_type: "CorporateBody", manifestation_id: 1>]

The productions method for a corporate body doesn't exist right off
the bat, but if I add it as a producer of a manifestation then all of
its other prouctions appear as set up in the text fixture.  One side
of the relation is getting set up right, but not the other.  There may
be some aspect of test fixtures and has_many_polymorphs that I don't
know about, but without net access I can't check it. I don't see
anything in the has_many_polymorphs docs and I can't see anything
relevant in its test fixtures.

I will leave it for now and check this in.

Next, I will set up an Ownership relation between Item and Group 2
entities that is otherwise identical to Production.

Check that in.

Now I'll redo the Creation model so it uses has_many_polymorphs.  I
think i'll do it the wrong way and just edit the migration that I
created earlier. Oh well.

* 23 August 2008

I did Creation and made a Realization model, so now all of the
relations between the Group 1 entites and Group 2 entities as
creators, realizers, producers, and owners exist.

The last big data model challenge will be to set up the many-to-many
Subject relation between Work and every other entity (because a Work
can have as a subject any Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item,
Person, Family, Corporate Body, Concept, Event, Object, or Place).
I'll use has_many_polymorphs for that, but there's the added twist
that there's a many-to-many Work-to-Work relationship in there, a
self-referential many-to-many relation, and I'll have to look into how
to make that work.  Can't remember if that'll require a bit of extra
configging or not.  If I can't get it to work I can always set up the
relations to all of the other entities and then add it in later.
That's one of the nice things about migrations.

TODO: Set up Subject relation between W and all entities.

Next, though, it's time to make it so that when I view a work I can
see a list of its creators, and so on for the other Group 1 entities.
I think a helper to generate the links will do the trick.

The generate_group2_entity_link_list method in
app/helpers/applications_helpers did that.

TODO: Noticed that when I'd made up the has_many :through relation for
Works and Group 2 entities I'd added a relation attribute to the
relation, e.g. "isAuthorOf." That's gone now. I could add in role or
something like that. Perhaps more appropriate for Expression?
Translator, conductor, performer, reader, etc.

That helper method I added was wrong. It should have been a partial
layout. I changed it.

TODO: Add more expressions for the works, and manifestations and items
for each, so that the hierarchical tree has enough in it to be
interesting.

TODO: See how to use Ajax drag and drop to move a manifestation from
one expression to another in that tree view, and have the connection
relation updated in the database.

TODO: Add an autocompleting search in the left nav that searches for
... just works? Or any entity, and it tells you what it is in
brackets?

TODO: Set up self-referential Work-to-Work relation with attributes
(hasSequel/isSequelOf etc.) and display that in the work views.

* 24 August 2008

Done: Edit familes, corporate bodies, and Group 3 entities.

TODO: One-button "remove" to drop a link between a G1 entity and a G2
entity, to go beside a name, to remove it as creator, owner, etc.

p = Person.find(5)
w = Work.find(1)
w.creators << p        # Create creation reation
w.creators.delete(p)   # Delete creation relation

Do this in an Ajaxy way so the page doesn't reload, the relation just
disappears. 

* 25 August 2008

TODO: After deleting an entity, delete all of the associations it has
with other entities.  If a Person is the realizer of an Expression and
the Person is deleted, e.realizers will still list the person as a
realizer.  (Use same function as above.)

Was reading a bit about routes.rb but I don't understand it all, or
what everything shown in rake routes means

Added  map.resources :creations
and edited   map.resources :works, :has_many => :expressions

which gives new URLs like /works/1/expressions/new, but a basic GET on
that just gives an error. I have no idea what's going on here.

Am unsure of the best way to handle remove the creation relation
between a Work and a G2 entity. Should I do it in a Creation
controller? If so, how? Or should it be a method in the Work
controller?  What is the RESTful way to do it?

I added the Aboutnesses model, which defines subject. (Took some
fiddling because I called it Subject first, which confused things, and
then I changed it to Aboutness, which is singular so it also confused
things. Lots of moving stuff around by hand.)

Now for a given work I can say w.subjects, but the name of the subject
is different in the three entities! Is it title, name, or term?  What
about item--what's the best way of referring to that on its own?  Hmm.

Maybe I need some sort of helper so if I pass in a class and an id, it
picks out the proper term to use in the display.

* 27 August 2008

Yesterday I set up the Aboutness model so I could say that a Work has
as subject this Concept or this Person or this Expression. The two W-E
relations confused things, though, and I couldn't get at the basic W-E
realization relation. I set up an aboutness branch in git and moved
the Aboutness stuff into there an worked on it until I had it figured
out--very nice.  I branche and then did a git reset --hard HEAD~2 on
the master branch to set it back to how it had been before I broke
things.

I turned W-E realization into a model of its own, with an attribute.
Since Realization was in use (for the relation between an Expression
and a G2 entity), I called it Reification.  That worked, but it
required a bunch of cleanup.  (Note that in FRBR all of the WEMI an
G1-G2 relations are uniquely named except for realization: an
expression realizes a work, and a G2 realizes an expression.  Caused
me confusion--worth pointing out.)

TODO: Set up Embodiment and Exemplification models for E-M and M-I
relations, with a relation attribute. Then every relation has a
model.  On the other hand, I don't think I need a model for M-I,
because it's a basic one-to-many relation without any attributes.
Probably good to set up a model just for completeness, though.

TODO: Make a partial layout so if I pass in an object it will tell me
every work for which the object is a subject (use Aboutness).

Then I added an anchor_text method to every class so that I can always
just refer to object.anchor_text and it will return a properly
formatted name for the object.  Work is title (form), Manifestation is
title (form_of_carrier, identifier), Person is name, Concept is term,
etc.  Went through all pages and updated them to use anchor_text.

----------

A thought about Reification, Embodiment and Exemplification models. I
made Reification a many-to-many relation but then thought it should be
one-to-many: one Work can have many Expressions. But that's wrong. An
expression could be an abridgement of two or more works, for example,
a Reader's Digest version of The Lord of the Rings. Does that count as
a new work on Tillett's chart? I don't have it with me so I don't
know, but I think it would (or could) count as a new expression of
several works at once.  So Reification should stay a many-to-many
model, for that reason and just so as not to limit implementattions
later.  I'm not sure what the FRBR report says about this but I'll
leave it as is.

----------

TODO: Do not assume that an E has only one W.  Anywhere we list the Ws
from which an E is reified, make it an array.  Allow one E to be
associated with multiple Ws with select lists. 

I took a stab at this and thought I had it working but ran into an
error I can't explain.

To start I defined this in expression.rb:

  def work
    # For expression e, e.work a Work object representing
    # the first Work for which this Expression is a reification.
    # (And only, if there is just one.) 
      Work.find(reifications[0].work_id)
  end

and it worked fine.  Then I set up a case in the test fixtures where
one E is an abridgment of three Ws. I made this method in expression.rb:

  def works
    # For expression e, e.works returns an array of all works 
    # for which e is a reification.
    works = []
    reifications.each do |r|
      works << Work.find(r.work_id)
    end
    works
  end

But e.works only works once!  Like so:

>> e=Expression.find(5)
=> #<Expression id: 5, created_at: "2008-08-27 17:09:44", updated_at: "2008-08-27 17:09:44", title: "Reader's Digest version of first three books", form: "text", date: "2000", language: "English", comment: "Test for one expression with many works.">
>> e.works
=> [#<Work id: 1, created_at: "2008-08-27 17:09:46", updated_at: "2008-08-27 17:09:46", title: "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", form: "novel", date: "1997", comment: "First book">, #<Work id: 2, created_at: "2008-08-27 17:09:46", updated_at: "2008-08-27 17:09:46", title: "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", form: "novel", date: "1998", comment: "Second book">, #<Work id: 3, created_at: "2008-08-27 17:09:46", updated_at: "2008-08-27 17:09:46", title: "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", form: "novel", date: "1999", comment: "Third book">]
>> e.works
=> []

What the hell?

I don't know what's going on here.  For now I'll go back to just
assuming there is one W for each E.  Have to ask about this.  

----------

TODO: Add methods to all of MI so that for each I can easily get an
array of an M's Es, an M's Ws, and I's Ws, etc.  Or some other simple
way of getting at all that.

----------

I will now merge this aboutness branch back into the master because
Aboutness works.

$ git checkout master
$ git merge aboutness

----------

Added a Subject controller and edited the routes and made an Ajaxy
thing to dynamically add a subject to a work without reloading the
page.  The new subject disappears if you follow a link and then come
back, though.  And if a WEMI is the subject of a work then there's a
problem if it has a non-unique title.

TODO: Add an intelligent autocompletion to the subject entry field
here so that it help you distinguish between two W or E with the same
title, tells you what the entity type is, etc.

----------

TODO:  On every entity page, add the ability to make that entity the
subject of a work.  (Use intelligent autocompletion for the works.)

----------

I have moved the TODOs into a TODO file and will keep this as just
narrative notes.

Installing Phusion Passenger on anvil.lisforge.net:

See 

    http://www.modrails.com/

# gem install passenger
# passenger-install-apache2-module

This complained that some Apache development stuff was missing. It
told me what to do.

# apt-get install apache2-prefork-dev

Then I went back to:

# passenger-install-apache2-module

It finished up and told me what configuration stuff to add to
Apache. I put this in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

# Passenger config stuff for Ruby on Rails
# Added 7 Sep 2008 by wtd
LoadModule passenger_module /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.0.3/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
PassengerRoot /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.0.3
PassengerRuby /usr/bin/ruby1.8

I set up a virtual host:

<VirtualHost *>
  # wtd
  ServerName   openfrbr.org
  ServerAlias  www.openfrbr.org
  DocumentRoot /var/www/openfrbr.org/public
  CustomLog    /var/log/apache2/openfrbr.org-access.log combined
  ErrorLog     /var/log/apache2/openfrbr.org-error.log

  <Directory /var/www/openfrbr.org/>
    Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </Directory>

</VirtualHost>

I copied all of the files into place.  I ran

$ rake db:schema:dump 

and copied db/schema.db onto anvil and put it in place.

On anvil I ran

$ rake db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=production

but it complained that Rails 2.1.0 was missing.  (I hadn't frozen
anything.)  It also complained that has_many_polymorphs was missing.

$ sudo gem install -v=2.1.0 rails
$ sudo gem install has_many_polymorphs
$ rake db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=production
$ rake db:fixtures:load RAILS_ENV=production

And it all works.

Trying a git repository.

And another.
