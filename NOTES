$ rails openfrbr

Used the notes here to put everything under git:

$ ./script/generate scaffold work

$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial checkin in; a bit of scaffolding"

On the Eee I ran

$ cd src
$ git clone buff@10.1.0.9:src/openfrbr 

and it copied everything over.

First database migration

$ ./script/generate migration create_works_table
      exists  db/migrate
      create  db/migrate/20080721001523_create_works_table.rb

I edited the file and added basic stuff to make the works table

class CreateWorksTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :works do |table|
      table.column :title, :string
      table.column :form, :string
      table.column :date, :date
      table.column :comment, :string
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :works
  end
end

$ rake db.migrate

There was a bunch of output about all the various tables.

* 25 July 2008

I'm not using these migrations right.  I wanted to load up the
development database with some initial data, and I knew that could be
done in migrations.  (Is this new to Rails 2?  Much of what I found
about this online seems out of date now.)  I made a new migration file
to load in the data, but it didn't take.  I then edited an early migration,
which didn't take either, so I had to do rake:db:migrate VERISON=0 to back to
the very start and then rake:db:migrate to catch up on everything.  I
don't know if this is the right way or not, but it works.

When I refreshed things on the Eee and ran script/server and hit
/works I got some kind of cookie error.  Data copied over by git that
shouldn't have been?  And then the migration stuff didn't work. Said
I'd already created the works table!

rake db:drop; rake db:migrate seems to work well for getting around any 
migration errors. It just drops everything and then you can start over.

Put a bunch of table configuration and test data into the migration files, 
including setting up the HABTM join tables.  Kept resetting the database 
and migrating it from scratch. Probably not the best way to do it, but it 
does sort of keep it tidy and gives me a decent baseline to work with for 
later, when I add attributes to the relationships between things.

* 31 July 2008

Did some more setting up of the entities and defining some test
data.  Didn't set up any relationships between PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
and Platform 9 3/4 as a place, though, or anything like that.

I had a look at the entity-relationship diagram I did that shows all of 
the FRBR entities and relationships, and realized my data model was wrong. 
I need to have attributes on the relationships, so instead of 
has_and_belongs_to_many I need to use has_many :through, and then set up 
the join with attributes.  A work can be created by Person A and also have 
Person B as a subject.  I don't want to clutter it all up with tons of 
different tables for all those joins.

Looked at a polymorphism plug-in but I don't feel like tackling that.

Since sqlite won't work on the Eee I tried to get it going with 
Postgresql, but I don't think I was running the daemon right because it 
couldn't connect.  I'd better tackle fixing sqlite again, before messing 
about with anything more serious.

* 2 August 2008

Checked FRBR and FRAD and updated the attributes on the entities.  Thought
about how to connect them all with has_many :through but haven't done
that yet.  Should use these expressions of FRBR in RDF:

  http://vocab.org/frbr/core
  http://vocab.org/frbr/extended
  
Created app/views/layouts/application.html.erb and then removed all of the
other layouts.  The application layout will be used by all views now.
I'll do a bit of CSS and styling to get a left nav going, or something
like that.

For fun I thought I'd try autocompletion on manifestation titles, just
to see how that worked.  Followed what is explained here:

  http://codeintensity.blogspot.com/2008/02/auto-complete-text-fields-in-rails-2.html
  
After a few minutes of this I decided I was getting ahead of myself, so I stopped.

Fiddled with the CSS so there's a left nav.

Removed public/index.html and added this to routes.rb:

  map.root :controller => "works"

Now the default for http://localhost:3000/ is to list all the works.

* 5 August 2008

I installed Ubuntu on my Eee and now I can use Rails without any
trouble.  I was getting errors with rake db:migrate on the old OS but
now all is well.

* 9 August 2008

After some fiddling around so that associated works are listed on the
subject pages, I'll try setting up has_many :through relations between
works and people just for starters. What I think I need is a
polymorphic many-to-many relationship between Group 1 and Group 2
entities, with attributes on the relationships.  Any Group 1 entity
can be in a variety of many-to-many relationships with any Group 2
entity, and if I can have that all in one model, that would be cool. I
think. I don't know. I'll start small and build up.  Not sure how this
will all go in migrations.  I think I need to use fixtures to set up
my test data.

I couldn't think of a word or phrase to sum up all of these different
relationships, so I just called the model TwoAndOne.

$ ./script/generate model TwoAndOne -g
      exists  app/models/
      exists  test/unit/
      exists  test/fixtures/
      create  app/models/two_and_one.rb
add 'app/models/two_and_one.rb'
      create  test/unit/two_and_one_test.rb
add 'test/unit/two_and_one_test.rb'
      create  test/fixtures/two_and_ones.yml
add 'test/fixtures/two_and_ones.yml'
      exists  db/migrate
      create  db/migrate/20080809163307_create_two_and_ones.rb
add 'db/migrate/20080809163307_create_two_and_ones.rb'

After some time not getting this to work, I decided to make a model
called Creator, and start by making it so that works and people were
in a many-to-many relationship this way.  That's more natural.
That's the way we talk.

./script/destroy model TwoAndOne -g

had a lot of output.

Later: Got this working.  My models look like this:

class Work < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :expressions
  has_many :people, :through => :creators
  has_many :creators
end

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :works, :through => :creators
  has_many :creators
end

class Creator < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :work
  belongs_to :person
end

I set up creators.yml with

one:
  work_id: 1
  person_id: 1
  relation: isAuthorOf

two:
  work_id: 2
  person_id: 1
  relation: isAuthorOf

three:
  work_id: 3
  person_id: 1
  relation: isAuthorOf

And now this does it in show.html.erb for people:

<ul>

<%- @person.creators.each do |c| %>

<li> <%= c.relation %> <%= link_to Work.find(c.work_id).title,
  :controller => "works",
  :action     => "show",
  :id         => c.work_id %> 
</li>

<%- end %>

</ul>

That says that she "isAuthorOf Harry Potter and the Philosopher's
Stone" and two others.

Getting families and corporate bodies into the mix won't be hard, but
I'm going to commit this now.

Question: How can I change the method name on people so that I can say
work.creators but person.creations?  I want the name of the
many-to-many relation to be different depending on which way I look at
it.  Must be some way to do that.

Later: Installed the has_many_polymorphs gem.

* 16 August 2008

Now I'm on the train back to Toronto.  The Creation and Creator models
are both broken, but I'm going to leave them that way for now.  To get
moving along I'm going to do a basic has_many :through polymorphic
relation to set up the Subject relationship.  Work is in a
many-to-many relationship with every other entity as a Subject: a Work
can have any of Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item, Person, Family,
Corporate Body, Concept, Event, Object, or Place as a subject.
There's only one relation: hasSubject (inverse isSubjectOf).

./script/generate model Subject -g

Hmm, I think that was stupid.  What I'd be doing there is a has_many
:through polymorphic association, which is what I was trying to do
with Creation, but couldn't get to work, so now I three broken and
incomplete things going on. 

All right, I'm going to revert to the last checkin to just wipe all
that out.

After more fooling around: bugger this, I need net access and I need
to get it working on a simple test example with no other stuff going
on.
